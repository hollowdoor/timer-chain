horologe
========

Install
-------

`npm install --save horologe`

`horologe` is now at version 2. There have been changes. Check this documentation to see what is different from version 1.

Usage
-----

```javascript
var Timer = require('horologe');
var count = 0;
var timer = Timer.create(1000, {sync: true});
timer.on('tick', function(time, passed){
    var d = new Date(time);
    console.log((++count) + ' ' + d.getHours()+':'+d.getMinutes()+':'+d.getSeconds() + ' ' + passed);
});
timer.start(20);
```

or create, and setup all at once.

```javascript
var count = 0, timer = Timer.create(1000, {sync: true}).on('tick', onTick).start(5);

function onTick(time, passed){
    var d = new Date(time);
    console.log((++count)+d.getHours()+':'+d.getMinutes()+':'+d.getSeconds() + ' ' + passed);
}
```

Timer creation
----------------------------------------

### new Timer(interval, options)

`interval` is the time between ticks.

`options` is an optional object argument.

There are two ways to create a timer.

```javascript
let timer1 = Timer.create(1000, {});
let timer2 = new Timer(1000, {});
```

options
-------

### options.sync = 1000

What should the timer be synchronized to? Using milliseconds you can adjust the timer synchronization to system time. Using a falsy value will set *no synchronization*.

### options.tick = null

Set a tick function. This is the same as `timer.on('tick', ()=>{})`

### options.highres = false

`options.highres` is an experimental option. Setting it will make the timer use `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()` for timing.

Properties
----

### timer.interval

The interval set in the constructor.

### timer.paused

Is the timer paused?

### timer.running

Is the timer running?

### timer.count

How many ticks of the timer have been done?

### timer.percent

What's the percentage of time complete until the timer is stopped by it's range? If the range is infinite `timer.percent` returns zero.

### timer.startTime

Get the time that the timer started. `timer.startTime` returns `null` if the timer is not running.

Methods
-------

### timer.start(wait)

Start the timer at the current time.

The `wait` parameter is optional. Specify an integer duration for the first tick to wait. If wait isn't set then the most optimal period before the first tick is chosen using rounding to the nearest interval in the past, or future.

If the timer has already started, and hasn't been paused `timer.start()` does nothing.

### timer.range(amount)

`timer.range(amount)` sets the time range, or when the timer ends. The default is `Infinity`.

### timer.stop()

Stop the timer. `timer.stop()` resets the timer entirely to a non-running, and non-paused state.


### timer.pause(limit)

Pause the timer.

`limit` has a default of `Infinity`.

`limit` controls how long the timer will be paused.


### on(name, callback)

Set a listener on an event.

### off(name, callback)

Remove a listener.

### dispose()

Destroy the timer.

Events
------

### tick

Emitted at every interval of the timer.

The arguments to the listener are `time`, and `passed`.

```javascript
timer.on('tick', function(time, passed){

});
```

`time` is the current system time.

`passed` is how much time has passed since the timer was started.

### start

Emitted when the timer is started.

`startTime` is the only argument for the `start` listener.

```javascript
timer.on('start', function(startTime){

});
```

### stop

Emitted when the timer is stopped. No arguments are passed to the listener.

### pause

Emitted when the timer is paused. No arguments are passed to the listener.

### complete

Emitted when the timer ends, and only if an amount is passed to the `range` method.

```javascript
timer.on('complete', (time, passed)=>{

});
```

About
-----

The `horologe` timer is very close to the `millisecond` precision. At worst it will be off by a 100th of a second. In my tests it remained in the 2 millisecond range of precision for most iterations of the interval. `horologe` doesn't use `precision.now` so keep that in mind.
